Before building, ensure npm is installed and from the project directory run `npm install`.
After doing that once, to build the site, ensure Hugo is installed and run the command `hugo`. The site will be written to the project's `public` directory.
You can also run `hugo server`, which will start a hot-reloading server at localhost:1313.
